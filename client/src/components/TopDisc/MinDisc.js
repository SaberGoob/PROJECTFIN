         <p> SubDelivery Freight Solutions has a mission to create the most 
            relationship-based freight solution company in the market.
            We have the advantage of leveraging over 70 years of combined
            experience to the table as we strive to build lasting relationships
            with our carriers and our shippers, creating a synergy that keeps our
            shippers coming back time and time again.</p>

        <h2>WHY SubDelivery FREIGHT SOLUTIONS FOR SHIPPERS?<div className='lineMinRight'></div>
</h2>
         <p> Any company can claim they’ll get your goods from door to door. But it takes a company that builds long-term relationships with shippers — and works to develop true partnerships
            — to become the freight solution of choice for today’s shippers.<br/>
One of the ways we develop strategic 
relationships with our shippers is by 
being the contractor of choice for carriers. By building relationships centered around trust with all stakeholders, shippers and carriers alike,
 we are able to create synergistic 
 relationships that benefit everyone, every step of the way.</p>
